# 🎧 Focusn’t

**Focusn’t** is a weird, useless, fun study-parody web app built entirely using **vibe coding**.

It does everything *except* help you study.

> 0% logic. 100% vibes.

## 🌀 What is Focusn’t?

Focusn’t is a satire of productivity and study apps.
Instead of optimizing learning, it focuses on:
- procrastination
- panic
- delusion
- emotional damage (a little)

It is intentionally **non-productive**.
